This wireframe outlines a simple end-to-end flow for discovering, viewing, and purchasing books. It’s structured around four core screens that cover the full user journey: **browse → view details → checkout → confirmation**.

## 📱 Screen 1 — Home Feed
A straightforward discovery screen where users can:
- Browse books by genre filters.
- Select their current location.
- View a “Just Added” section showing newly added books in a grid layout.

This screen exists purely to push users into exploration with minimal friction.

## 📘 Screen 2 — Book Information
A focused product detail page displaying:
- A large book preview placeholder.
- Book title, author, and publication year.
- A brief description.
- Owner information and rating.
- A clear primary action: **Purchase for $20**.

This page is built for clarity—no distractions, just what’s needed to decide.

## 💳 Screen 3 — Payment Details
A compressed checkout page that includes:
- Order summary with item, price, and shipping.
- Total cost breakdown.
- Payment method options (Credit Card, Cash on Delivery, UPI).
- Shipping address field.

Everything is contained in one view to minimize drop-off.

## ✅ Screen 4 — Order Success
A simple confirmation screen showing:

Designed to give closure without noise.
